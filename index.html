					<h2>Goals</h2>
					<p>
						The primary goals of this website revolve around the creation of a dynamic and user-friendly website that
						connects high school students with local non-profit organizations in New York. This platform intends to
						simplify the process of discovering and participating in community service opportunities. By streamlining
						the engagement process, the project aims to inspire a greater number of students to actively participate in
						volunteer work, fostering a sense of community involvement among the younger generation.

					<h2>Importance</h2>
					<p>
						Volunteering plays an important role in the personal and social development of high school students.
						Engaging in volunteer activities exposes students to diverse experiences, fostering empathy, teamwork, and a
						sense of belonging. Volunteering also nurtures important life skills such as time management, communication,
						and problem-solving.

						Research underscores the significance of volunteerism in society. Notably, age groups between 35 to 44 and
						45 to 54 exhibit the highest volunteer rates, with percentages of 31.5% and 30.8%, respectively. This
						highlights the need to engage younger demographics, such as high school students, to ensure the continuation
						of volunteer efforts in the future.
